Once upon a version, I had the accelerometer display working.
I changed the code for the next part of the tutorial, the shake alert, 
and couldn't get it to function as it should, so I reverted to this code, and now
it no longer works as it did before.
I am still working on the phone and twitter API sections of the tutorial, and will publish to 
github and link on the homework page once that is done.
